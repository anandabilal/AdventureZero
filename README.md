AdventureZero is a zero-player game where you can start an adventure and let the character kill monsters and gain EXP.
The more EXP your character gains, the more level he will get, and the more level he gets, the more powerful he'd become.

To start, you need to click "START" and if you want to stop, click "STOP".
You can also save your progress by clicking "SAVE", it will then save your progress, stats, level on a file to your Desktop.

Whenever you want to load that save file, you can just click "LOAD" and the progress will revert back according to that save file.

Happy hunting!
